# Weather_Data_Analysis
Description
This project analyzes daily weather data using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The goal is to explore weather patterns, visualize relationships between variables, and predict rainfall using linear regression. The analysis demonstrates that temperature variations can help forecast rainfall with reasonable accuracy.
1. Data Exploration: We loaded the weather dataset, examined its structure, and summarized key statistics to understand the data.
2. Data Visualization: We visualized relationships between weather variables using pair plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
3. Feature Engineering: We created a new feature, Temperature Difference (TempDiff), by subtracting MinTemp from MaxTemp.
4. Statistical Analysis: We calculated the average maximum temperature based on WindGust direction to identify trends.
5. Additional Visualizations: Scatter plots were used to examine the correlation between TempDiff and Rainfall.
6. Advanced Analysis: We applied Linear Regression to predict rainfall using MinTemp and MaxTemp as input features.
7. Model Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores.
8. Results and Insights: We compared predicted rainfall with actual values and visualized the outcomes using graphs and tables.
